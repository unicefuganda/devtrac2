STRIDES goal is to increase the use of quality reproductive health/family planning (RH/FP) and child survival (CS) services at the facility and community levels in fifteen selected districts in Uganda.  The project aims to increase the use of RH/FP/CS services by working in partnership with the MOH, local governments and key existing civil society organizations on activities to achieve the following three intermediate results: 1) increase quality and provision of routine RH/FP and CS services in facilities; 2) increase the ability of communities to provide RH/FP and CS services; and 3) strengthen supportive systems to advance the use of RH/FP and CS services.","28/01/2013","28/01/2013","28/07/2013","28/07/2013","Kumi","Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","Implementation","Social, Small and medium-sized enterprises","1.4976","33.8862"

"62","USAID","Envision","Envision is a five-year, $240 million integrated project in 10 countries, implemented by RTI to control and eliminate the five neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) which may be treated through preventive chemotherapy: lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), onchocerciasis (river blindness), schistosomiasis (snail fever), trachoma, and three soil-transmitted helminths (hookworm, ringworm and whipworm).  All of these diseases are endemic in Uganda. The approximate annual budget for Uganda is $1.5M. Most of the drugs are donated through pharmaceutical donation programs. Nearly 30 million people are at risk of one or more of these NTDs in Uganda, which can cause sickness and severe disability. Although diseases may overlap in some areas, they are not uniformly co-endemic within districts, resulting in a complex map of NTD prevalence. Building on the existing experience of NTD control in Uganda, USAID support for integrated NTD Control began in 2007 and is largely responsible for the treatment of over 14 million people annually. Working closely with the Ministry of Health and other partners to provide integrated mass drug administration (MDA) for NTD control, RTI provides assistance for advocacy, capacity building, community mobilization, training, and health education. MDAs are included as part of the National Child Health Days, a school-based approach that mitigates redundant health program costs, combines distribution schedules, and facilitates improved access to healthcare for children. Through Envision, USAID will further the development of evidence-based policies and standards globally.","20/01/2008","10/1/11","20/07/2008","10/7/11","Budaka","Research Triangle Institute (RTI)","Implementation","Development","1.0567","33.926"
