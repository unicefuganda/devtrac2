Poor accessibility to contraceptive services physically, economically, and culturally is a key driver of unmet need for contraception in Uganda. The total fertility rate (TFR) in Uganda remains high at 6.7 children per woman and virtually unchanged since 1996, when TFR stood at 6.9 children per woman. This unmet need translates into Ugandan women having, on average, 1.6 more children than they would ideally want.","5/21/10","5/21/10","5/20/15","","Sembabule","Marie Stopes Uganda","Implementation","Family planning","-0.1509","31.422"

All of these diseases are endemic in Uganda. The approximate annual budget for Uganda is $1.5M. Most of the drugs are donated through pharmaceutical donation programs. Nearly 30 million people are at risk of one or more of these NTDs in Uganda, which can cause sickness and severe disability. 

Although diseases may overlap in some areas, they are not uniformly co-endemic within districts, resulting in a complex map of NTD prevalence. Building on the existing experience of NTD control in Uganda, USAID support for integrated NTD Control began in 2007 and is largely responsible for the treatment of over 14 million people annually.
