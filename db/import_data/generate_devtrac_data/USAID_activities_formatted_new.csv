This is a cooperative agreement to improve access, especially at the community level and in rural areas, to affordable, quality family planning services and a wide range of contraceptive methods, including long-acting and permanent methods. This project is an essential building block in USAIDs efforts to help satisfy the high level of unmet demand for family planning in Uganda. Poor accessibility to contraceptive services physically, economically, and culturally is a key driver of unmet need for contraception in Uganda. The total fertility rate (TFR) in Uganda remains high at 6.7 children per woman and virtually unchanged since 1996, when TFR stood at 6.9 children per woman. This unmet need translates into Ugandan women having, on average, 1.6 more children than they would ideally want.","5/21/10","5/21/10","5/20/15","","Ntungamo","Marie Stopes Uganda","518","Social, Small and medium-sized enterprises","-0.8819","30.2653"
