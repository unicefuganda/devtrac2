The district team briefed the UNICEF team of the key challenges they face in service delivery. The main challenge is the hardship to deliver service especially on the 8 islands in Lake Victoria. The district also faces a big gap in human resource for example, health staffing is only at 19% of the required posts. The district is also among the 36 poorly performing districts for the EPI indicators in Uganda. There is an obvious need for support in this district in areas of health.
